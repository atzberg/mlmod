Mlmod: Machine Learning Modeling Package

http://atzberger.org/

----------------------------------------------------------------
Make files for building the MLMOD package as part of LAMMPS.

Copy these Makefiles to your LAMMPS source sub-directory 
MAKE or MAKE/MINE 

Depending on the version of LAMMPS you may need to change
the name of MPI link library in the Makefile or in the 
/STUBS/ directory (use symbolic link).   

The Makefiles may need edits to adjust for the location 
of the dependent libraries.
